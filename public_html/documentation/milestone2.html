<h1>Header/Image:</h1>
<p>I will have a header with my name and an image in the background. Directly below that there will be a Navbar with buttons that
will take users to the different sections of the site (About me, Portfolio and contact me).
</p>

<h1>About me:</h1>
<p>In the about me section, I will have a Jumbotron with a picture of myself. In the Jumbotron, I will have text talking
about myself. Telling users where I am from, my education skills my work place skills and things that I have learned in the
boot camp (javascript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, ETC).
</p>

<h1>Portfolio:</h1>
<p>In the portfolio section, I will use cards to showcase some of my work. There will be a picture of the site/ project
and some text talking about what the project was and what I did to complete it. Some examples of the projects I would be
showcasing are, CSS challenge, Javascript challenge, Capstone and other. I would like to list at least 3 different projects
in this section.

message. Below there will also be icons that will redirect users to my Github, Linkedin and Discord (or a different site)</p>
